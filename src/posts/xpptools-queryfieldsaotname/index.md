In the standard Advanced query filter dialog, when you select a field to filter, standard lookup displays only field labels. Sometimes, it is more convenient to filter by field AOT name(and not by the label)

This tool adds a new column in the standard Field lookup dialog, so you can search the required field by label or by AOT name
