I currently use the following approach:

- Use v5 VMs with 15HDDs(or SSDs), v5 provides you a different development experience, everything is faster

- I restart VS before any debug session and use Debug Attach Manager to run debugger https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ViktarKarpach.DebugAttachManager

- For infolog messages use this tool, in lot of cases it allows to understand the issue without debugger https://denistrunin.com/xpptools-devinfocallstack/

 

So for 10.0.25 this works pretty good

In 10.0.27 MS will add a filter for loaded modules, maybe it will be more stable
