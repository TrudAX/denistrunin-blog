I need a presentation for the "External Integration" module. In should be in Microsoft style, the module itself is described in this series of blog posts: https://denistrunin.com/tags/integration/  
The External Integration framework provides a standardized approach to developing X++ based integrations.  
From my understanding, it should be something like that:
The first slide should show the name and what steps the framework provides: Design - Template for requirements - Sample integrations for common scenarios(Sales line, Ledger Journals, Purch lines, Vendors ) - Performance testing

Then slide with supported integration types :
Inbound
Outbound event-based
Outbound periodic 
Service based 

And different formats:
CSV
EDI
Excel
XML
JSON

Different channels:
Service bus
SFTP
Azure file share
Web service REST API
AI (LLM) 
Manual

Then slide with an advantage over the standard Microsoft 
DMF, Business Events, Message processor 

Then several slides regarding the last blog post: https://denistrunin.com/integration-importpurchpdf/

and questions
